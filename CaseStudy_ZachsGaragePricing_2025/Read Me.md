## Problem Statement
Zach‚Äôs Garage, a specialized car detailing service, struggles with determining the **best pricing strategy**.  

While premium services attract customers willing to pay higher amounts, uncertainty exists regarding:

- **Which price point maximizes revenue without driving customers away?**  
- **What trade-offs exist between affordability, customer loyalty, and profitability?**  

The business needs an **evidence-based framework** to evaluate pricing scenarios and guide decision-making.
